      <h2>Fact #2, I was adopted!</h2>
      <p>I was adopted! My parents flew from NYC to Bolivia in April to come get me and bring me home. I don't know a word of spanish because I grew up in the United States. I grew up in Darien, CT where my father grew up. My adopted parents aren't latino so I never learned spanish.</p>

      <h2>Growing up in America</h2>
      <p>This might sound weird but I am forever grateful for growing up in a country like the United States. Was it tough? Yes. Why? Because the town I grew up in is a prodominantly white town. Growing up I was one of a few colored kids attending my school. I was different and I knew it.</p>
